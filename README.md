# Hroot Bulk Mail sending fix

Create this app to overcome an issue with Hroot - since we have moved out Outlook server into the cloud, sendingh messages through it
has become incredibly slow and unreliable. The sedning messages code can get stuck, and needs a kick to get it going again.

This app allows the user to reset the Bulk Sending process.

Once I have a handle on how to manage this from within Hroot, I hope this app can be deleted
