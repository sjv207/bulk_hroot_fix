# Hroot Bulk Mail sending fix

Created this app to overcome an issue with Hroot - since we have moved our Outlook server into the cloud, sending messages through it has become incredibly slow and unreliable. The sending messages code can get stuck, and needs a kick to get it going again.

This app allows the user to reset the Bulk Sending process.

Once I have a handle on how to manage this from within Hroot, I hope this app can be deleted
